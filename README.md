# AI - DeepQLearning in Snake Game

<br>

## Description
Implementation, experimentation and analysis of a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Deep Q Learning, applied to an agent in the Snake game, in order to observe the evolution of the score as well as the time needed to reach a certain objective.

### Technologies:
- Python 
- PyTorch
- PyGame
